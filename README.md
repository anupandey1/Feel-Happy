## Feel-Happy
Have a look: https://feel-happy-anu.netlify.app/  \
I was fascinated with the variety of APIs. So I have made an attempt by fetching few APIs and developed a feel‐good personal website which
aims in making the user cheerful and stress-free .\
It fetches:\
• Your BMI and weight status , taking weight and height as input.\
• Weather info of any city for you to plan trips.\
• A random joke to enhance the mood of the user.

I also used my previous project,https://anupandey1.github.io/Weather-App/ (my first attempt to fetch an api)
